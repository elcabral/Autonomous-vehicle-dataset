# Autonomous-vehicle-dataset
This dataset consists of about 130 thousand data samples captured at a rate of 10 fps, completing more than 3Â½ hours of video. The videos are collected at different hours of the day with different weather conditions. Associated with each image of the videos there are 4 parameters: steering wheel angle, accelerator and brake pedal pressures, and vehicle speed. For collecting this data, a human driver drove the vehicle inside the GTA-V game environment.
